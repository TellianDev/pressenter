Hello again, world!\
I'm back to blogging, with much more experience in life and on the web (a different kind of life). Still, room for growth is virtually infinite, so bear with me.

### Why pressEnter

This name is a statement I make for myself, to always remember to commit, to go all the way, to be bold and adventurous, back to being a risk-taker like there is nothing to lose ; because let's be honest, there isn't much to lose, and freedom is yet to be earned.

### What should you expect

Don't. Expectations are good for things you control. You don't control me. But I will do my very best to share with you what I find particularily interesting, fun, promising, and sometimes worrying.\
What I want most is to keep being hopeful that the web is the place I fell in love with when I could barely even read, and my internet connection had 56 kbps of bandwidth in the mid 90s.
We're coming to a time period where most of the internet traffic will be done by LLMs scrapping everything they can, and soon will generate most of its content. The rest of which is still generated by humans, but on oligopolistic platforms ran by billionnaires who don't have your best interest in mind. So let's keep creating on what we own.



### Who am I

Who knows, does it even matter?
You're one query away from knowing a name, but many blog posts away from truly understanding the person. Keep reading.
